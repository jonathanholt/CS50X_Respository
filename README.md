# CS50X_Respository
All of the mini-projects I completed for Harvard University's online CS50X course.

## Summer 2014 ##

In 2014 I completed Harvard's introductory CS50X course. The course saw students first complete a variety of tasks in C, including image manipulation and encyrption tasks. In the later weeks, there was a greater focus on creating larger web applications using JavaScript and PHP.

0.  GIF = 256. JPEG = 16,777,216. BMP = 256. PNG = 16,777,216 
1.  GIF
2.  Lossless and Lossy compression reduce an images filesize, the primary difference being that lossless compression allows the
original image to be recreated with a high degree of accuracy. Conversely, lossy compression changes are not reversable. 
3.  JPEG
4.  When a file is deleted, the pointer to that file is deleted but the data is still recoverable. 
5.  You can overwrite data using a program that replaces all data with 0 values.
6. stdint is a header file that lets you utilise some defined variables representing different
byte sizes. These variables all have a defined 'width'. e.g. 32-bit
7. All of these variables represent different sizes, or widths. It is useful to use them when working
with image files for example to search for patterns of bytes.
8. BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes
9. BM
10. bfSize is the size of the entire BMP file, while biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER.
11. If biHeight is negative, it means the image is a top-down DIB, meaning that is has been stored in memory starting from the bottom-left hand
pixel.
12. biBitCount 
13. If there is no free space to write the file, or the user doesn't have the permission to write in the file.
14. The third arguement of fread represents how many elements (specified in size) should be read. In whodunit.c we want to iterate over
the image pixel-by-pixel, so 1 is appropriate.
15. 3 bytes
16. fseek allows you to change to a different position in the file.
17. SEEK_CUR means you want to jump a certain amount of bytes form the current position.

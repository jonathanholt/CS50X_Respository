tabletop-game-aggregator
========================

Dated- May 2014
Web-based online course project. A website that users can join and input data about a tabletop game to record their own win/loss
ratio.
The project was built primarily using php to render the pages and communicate with a mySQL database. Two databases were created;
a user database storing user details and a game database storing all game details.

Users could view their own statistics or fill in a form to view specific statistics that would, in turn, query the game database.

The website was run successfully using a local server but is no longer online.
